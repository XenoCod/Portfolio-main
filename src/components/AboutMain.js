                I have been developing websites & single page web apps since
                past 2 years. My go-to programming language is{" "}

                . When it comes to programming I mostly enjoy coding in{" "}

                and always try to find the right solution for a problem. Well, I
                like to experiment as much as I can, on food and on my life. My
                body is made up of HTML & CSS, which is literally me! This
                defines me as a Full Stack Developer (Front End, Back End,
                Middleware, Whatever...)

                I am a highly motivated, passionate, hard-core web developer
                with diverse experience in developing web apps ranging from{" "}
                <b>cute layouts, payment gateways, clones</b> and much more. I
                have a real passion for development and using my design
                experience I leverage my knowledge of typographic relationships
                and design patterns to create aesthetically pleasing but also
                very viable digital experiences. I find it incredibly rewarding
                to write not only clean code but to witness and be apart of the
                solution bringing a design into development..

                Coming to other interests, I'm huge FIFA fan. I love to play &
                watch Football &
                <span style={{ color: "red" }}> Manchester United</span> to be
                precise. I had actively pursued football in school and college,
                made great friends because of it and had fun playing alongside
                so many amazing people.
